I’m excited today because I’m going to walk you through how we onboard agents onto our team here at Anthony Realtors.

**Our onboarding consists of a six-week program that covers every single thing that you need to know in the real estate industry.** When you take classes to get your real estate license you'll learn about license law but you don’t necessarily learn how to sell a house. We designed our onboarding to pick up where these classes leave off.

The first class will teach you what it’s like to take on a new client and the lifetime value that each client holds. If you’re a brand-new agent who isn’t sure how to grow their business enough to make this a full-time job, we cover that too.

The second class focuses on time blocking and mindset, which are two very important things in real estate. **Other classes cover our CRM, transaction management, buyers, sellers, open houses and showings, documents and processes, negotiations, and online leads.**&nbsp;

The 12th and final class is a recap class of everything, and after this, you’ll be able to take a lead day at our company. You’ll learn about many things throughout this process, including our custom listing presentations, scripting, and more.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us or any of this sounds interesting to you, we would love to see you at one of our next sessions. Give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions in the meantime.

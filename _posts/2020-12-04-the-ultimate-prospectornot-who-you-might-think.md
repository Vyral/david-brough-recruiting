In my eight years of owning my dog, I’ve finally figured something out about him: **He’s the ultimate prospector.**&nbsp;

What he’s looking for is human food. That’s what he wants. It’s his life purpose. Every time I eat, he’s somewhere in the background waiting for scraps. Most of the time he gets nothing, but once in a while he gets what he wants, and that’s because he always puts himself in the right position. He always shows up with zero loss of enthusiasm.

His approach is similar to how real estate works. We prospect daily, but we might go through three- or four-day stretches without booking any solid appointments. **Successful real estate agents know that consistency is key, though.** They know they need to show up for their clients, prospects, and leads every single day without any loss of enthusiasm, regardless of whether or not they booked any appointments that week.&nbsp;

If you’d like to talk more about what it takes to be a great prospector or have any real estate questions I can answer, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you, and I hope you have a safe, happy holiday season.

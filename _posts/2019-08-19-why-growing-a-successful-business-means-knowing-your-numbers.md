Business is math.&nbsp;

What I mean is, your business is determined by simple math—how many people you meet and talk to per day, the number of contracts you write, etc. It all boils down to numbers, which is boring for some people, but **knowing your daily numbers is one of the most important things an agent can do.&nbsp;**

Imagine you know for sure that every 40 people you talk to equals one sale. This will motivate you not to quit your day early if you’ve only spoken to, say, five people, because you’ll know that all you need to do is talk to more people. Knowing your numbers will also push you on the days you don’t want to do your prospecting or follow-ups.&nbsp;

How can you track your numbers? The simplest, least expensive way is to use an excel spreadsheet. You can also check out a program called Career Technical Education, which tracks all different kinds of numbers and costs (to my recollection) about $30 per month. The best tool for this, in my opinion, is the business management software Sisu, but that’s also the most expensive option.&nbsp;

The point is, **you need to know your numbers and know what it takes to produce a sale.** Whether it’s how many showings you host per month or how many people you talk to daily, you’ll find this number once you start tracking. After you get some sales under your belt, you’ll better understand what it takes to get more sales.&nbsp;

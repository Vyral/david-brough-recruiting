Due to the COVID-19 health crisis, our industry has had to adapt quickly, like countless others. One of the most effective tools that we’re leveraging these days is the 3D Matterport system, which enables immersive virtual tours. Though we’d been using it prior to the pandemic, its value has only increased amid social distancing and shelter-in-place provisions. Essentially, Matterport is a closed system comprising a specialized camera and a Matterport server. After our photographer uses the camera to scan a home, the photos are uploaded to the server and processed for roughly five hours. The result is an awesome, interactive portrait of the property that I’ll show you today.&nbsp;

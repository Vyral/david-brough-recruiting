There are over 25 negotiations in a real estate transaction. You’re dealing with your client, the other agent, their client, inspectors, lenders, and many others. It can be tricky to keep all the moving parts working fluidly, but it’s your job as a real estate agent. You are a negotiator.

“Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss provides some great tips that can help us all become better agents and negotiators. Some of the best takeaways include:

* **“We are in a business of trust.”** Trust equals predictability, so we can establish trust with our clients by simply being predictable.&nbsp;
* **Communicate and set expectations with your clients.** Home sellers have a lot on the line, and they want to know what’s going on. Make sure they understand exactly what’s going on and what you’re doing, and let them know when you will be contacting them. If you set up a routine of when you’ll contact them, they’ll be less worried and be able to save their questions for when you call.

These simple approaches can make your life easier as an agent, and there are many more helpful tips found in the book. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

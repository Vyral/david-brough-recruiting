While we’re all stuck at home during this pandemic, I’ve seen a lot of real estate agents slack off when it comes to not only their business but also their health. **When you combine these things, it can lead to irritability, depression, and a downward negative spiral.&nbsp;**

That’s the opposite of what we need to be right now for ourselves, our families, and our clients. If you’ve found yourself slacking, I’ve got some tips to share to help you get out of the funk.&nbsp;

Now is the time to get out there and exercise, eat healthily, and stick to a routine schedule. This will help keep your mind sharp. **We’re all in this together and most of us are stuck at home, but there’s an opportunity to come out of this with a huge surge of business.** The people that stick to that normal routine are the ones who will succeed on a super high level when we get on the other side of this.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me or need some advice on how to make corrections in your schedule to ensure future success, give me a call or send an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.

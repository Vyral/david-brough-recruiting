Today I’m interviewing the newest member of Anthony REALTORS, David Affholter, so he can share his story and offer some advice to brand-new agents. As David can attest, there are certain challenges you’ll inevitably have to overcome when you start out, but if you work through them and help to improve people’s lives, you’ll end up better off on the other side.

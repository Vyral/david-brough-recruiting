I'd crop/tweak/combine the 1st 2 paragraphs: "When our homebuyers are competing against other buyers for great homes in this hot spring market, we have a secret that helps their offers stand out in the crowd: a buyer offer letter. **This one-page document prepared by your buyers is sent in with the offer.** Sellers receive many offers in a hot market like this, but adding this letter to the fold can establish an emotional connection with the seller, increasing the chances they'll accept your offer over others.

This could help you edge out other buyers in a competitive situation because it’s not always about the money for people. It’s an emotional process, and spending that time to write the buyer offer letter can be super helpful.

This is a great thing to introduce to buyers from the get-go. If there’s a home they really like, **have them draft a letter that lets the seller know about their home buying journey, how the home appeals to their family, and how well the home is prepared.&nbsp;**

This is just one tool to help your clients’ offers get accepted. If you’d like to take a look at some examples, let us know. Also, if you have any questions for us in the meantime or if we can help you out in any way, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

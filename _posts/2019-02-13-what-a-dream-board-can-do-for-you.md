If you need help making your goals a reality in 2019, **I highly recommend making a dream board for yourself.**

A dream board is a compilation of images that represent both the goals you want to achieve and the process of achieving them. The idea is to place the board in a spot where you’ll see it often so that you will always be reminded of these goals and your mind will develop a laser-like focus for them.

**Essentially, a dream board allows you to visualize your goals and create an emotional connection to them.** Humans are visual creatures, after all. We respond to visual cues better than anything else.

I’ve attached a picture of my dream board in the video above to give you an idea of what yours can look like. I have this board sitting in my bedroom so I see it every morning when I wake up. I also have that same picture set as my laptop screensaver. As I said, a dream board is supposed to invoke emotion, and when I see my two kids on my dream board, it stirs up positive emotions for me and gets me super motivated.

If you make a dream board for 2019, I guarantee you’ll achieve your goals a lot faster.

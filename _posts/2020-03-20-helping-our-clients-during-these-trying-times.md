I believe it’s important for us agents to guide our clients and address their concerns over the coronavirus and its impact on our real estate market. It’s our job to deliver the facts rather than get caught up in the hysteria.&nbsp;

When talking to our database, it’s key to mention that interest rates are still incredibly low. While some sellers may hold off on listing their home until they see what happens in the market, there will still be houses for sale, and plenty of credit for buyers to buy those houses. **The market is still healthy, and if we don’t educate people, we’re a part of the problem—not the solution.&nbsp;**

For example, we can make educational videos about the stock market’s impact on real estate or how sellers can host open houses while protecting themselves and others. I think now’s also a wonderful opportunity to start holding meetings via video conference, or offer 3-D virtual tours of homes as part of your marketing package. Additionally, you can do video walk-throughs of homes for buyer clients so they don’t have to go out as much.&nbsp;

In general, **there are a lot of opportunities to solve problems right now, and that’s what we do every day.** We’re professional problem solvers, and this is a problem we must address. It’s scary, but it’s also exciting to see what the future holds.&nbsp;

I look forward to the day when the coronavirus is under control and we can all go back to our normal schedule, but until that happens we need a backup plan to help the people we serve.&nbsp;

If you have thoughts on this subject you’d like to share or have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to hear from you.

What is your unique selling proposition (USP)?

In case you’ve never heard of this term, **a unique selling proposition is something that creates a level of separation between you and your competition.** In real estate, for example, an agent might say something like:

* I always answer my phone
* I always return phone calls or texts within two hours of receiving them
* I always do my own open houses and show my own listings
* I guarantee if you’re not satisfied with your home purchase, I’ll sell it for free
* If you’re not completely satisfied with my level of service, you can get out of your contract at any time&nbsp;

You can use your USP on your website, in your marketing material, etc. In any case, it’s our job to sell houses, but it’s also our job to market ourselves. There’s a lot of noise in the market. **People need to know why they should choose you over someone else,** and establishing a USP is an easy way to separate yourself from the competition. If you work in a niche market, there might be something within that niche that’s very attractive to consumers.&nbsp;

If you don’t have a USP, think of a few that might work for you and will make sense for your customer base. If you need help thinking of one or you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d love to help\!

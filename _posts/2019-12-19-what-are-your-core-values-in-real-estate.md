Core values define what you are, whether you work for yourself or with an organization. As a real estate agent, you are a business owner, and discovering your core values is an important part of building a successful business. As such, it’s essential to take time and reflect on what you want your business to represent.

It’s good to focus on about three to seven values. These values allow you to declare who you are as a person and what you’re looking to attract in your business.

**Personally, reflecting on and defining my core values has helped my business immensely.** Most of all, it provided me with clarity. I was able to begin attracting the types of clients and agents I wanted to work with, and I found others who shared my core values.&nbsp;

At Anthony REALTORS, our core values are:

* God above all
* Commitment
* Respect
* Follow through
* Improvement
* Servant hearts

Many of these values focus on serving our customers and providing them with the best real estate experience possible. These values set the standards and expectations for our business, and each decision we make is filtered through them.&nbsp;

**If you are looking to bring your business to the next level, establishing your core values can help you create a better path for the future.** You’ll see some amazing things happen when you begin guiding your business with the help of your core values.

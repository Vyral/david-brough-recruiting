No one likes to do it, but it’s crucial to know how to do it correctly: delivering bad news. Maybe you have to call a buyer or seller and tell them the other party cannot accomplish their commitment to close on the deal, or you may have to call the seller and tell them the appraisal came in $20,000 below what you thought it would. You could have to convey negative news to anyone in any situation. I’ve found three things that work best when delivering unfavorable news:

**1\. Get the facts straight.** When you receive the grim news, take the time to ensure you have all the information.

**2\. Put yourself in the right mindset.** If you’re tired, maybe get up and take a quick walk. If you’re in a crummy mood, do some breathing exercises. Do what’s necessary to mentally prepare to be the best you can be for the clients receiving the bad news.&nbsp;

**3\. Deliver the news as soon as possible.** Do it quickly, don’t waste any time. Don’t wait until the end of the day or the next day. When you speak with them, don’t start with small talk—get right to the point. Often they’ll sense something’s wrong if you beat around the bush. People respect you more when you’re direct about it.&nbsp;

We practice these things on our team to ensure we’re conveying negative news in the best way possible.

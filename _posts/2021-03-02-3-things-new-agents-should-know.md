I’ve been in this business for about 10 years now, and in that time, I’ve learned many things. Today I want to share a few things that aspiring and new real estate agents should know that will help you right away:

**1\. You have to talk to a lot of people, including calling and texting them.** There’s no way around this; you won’t suddenly stumble across a bunch of killer leads without communicating with people. The sooner you come to terms with this and embrace it, the faster your career will launch.

**2\. It’s going to take time.** If you’re just getting started in the industry, don’t think that because you’ve done this for three months and you haven’t had a deal yet that you need to give up. I honestly wouldn’t even start tracking your success until after your first year. To make it in this business, you’ll need to put a lot of work in, and that will take time. There’s a lot of responsibility involved with trying to get a consumer to trust you with one of the biggest purchases or sales of their entire life. There’s also a lot of competition in the way of other agents, so just trust the process and respect the fact that it takes time to hone your skills and nurture leads.

**3\. It’s okay if your friends and family don’t use you as an agent.** In fact, they might feel like they’re obligated to use you when they don’t really want to. They may have another agent in mind that has been doing a better job for them than you’re able to right now. Don’t get upset if this happens; they likely have a valid reason for working with the agent they’ve chosen.

If you have any more questions about jumpstarting your real estate career, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to share the knowledge I’ve gained over the years with you.

I’m Dave Affholter, a real estate agent on the Anthony REALTORS team. **I began as a new agent with this team and sold 24 homes in my first year.** Today I’m sharing a little about what it’s like to work at Anthony REALTORS.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

When I told other real estate agents that I had begun working with Anthony REALTORS, they said I would be taken care of and was in the best place for a new agent. I have not regretted one moment of it; joining this team has been one of the best career decisions I’ve ever made. I’ve been completely satisfied with how I’m treated and respected, the people I work with, the vision and values of the company, and the consideration shown to clients. I haven’t seen all these things in other places I’ve worked, so to have all of this is fantastic.&nbsp;

**If you’re onboarding agents, you need to set them up for achievement;** supply them with the tools to be successful. Whether they follow through or not is up to them, but you should provide the right opportunities.

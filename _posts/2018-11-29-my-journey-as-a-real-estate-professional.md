Every agent has a story of how they got started in real estate; a journey of overcoming challenges, facing daily struggles, and eventually, finding success as a professional. I went down paths ranging from college student to manual laborer before I caught my first glimpse of a future in real estate. After flipping a home in 2007, I began to slowly build a listing inventory as I found new homes to invest in and renovate. I came to realize that all my efforts didn’t have to go into fixing up houses—in fact, it made much more sense to help people buy and sell their homes. I’ve been doing that very thing ever since. To hear the story of my journey from an amateur agent to a professional, watch this video.

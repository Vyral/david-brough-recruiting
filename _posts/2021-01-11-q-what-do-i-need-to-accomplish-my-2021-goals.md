It’s the beginning of 2021, and you probably have some big goals for this year. However, you won’t reach these goals without understanding two basic principles:

**1\. Goals are a result of a process.** Instead of focusing on your goals themselves, focus on the process. If your goal is to sell 40 houses, for example, you want to focus on your lead generation and conversion skills, your clients’ experience, and your systems.

**2\. You have to change your belief system.** If you see yourself as a healthy person, but you’re not willing to sacrifice some discomfort by getting up and going on a run, you’re not congruent with what you say and you’re always going to fall. That goes with any endeavor. The belief system has to change for you to achieve your goals. Don’t just say you’re going to do something; do it.

Once you become that person, you’re well on your way to achieving your goals. If you have any questions about your goals for 2021 and the processes you need to focus on to get there, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Whether you have a small or large database, a great way to categorize it is a method my team and me use: tagging.

**Tagging is a basic function of a CRM.** We have between 9,000 and 10,000 people in our database, and we use the letter-grading system to tag them: A, B, C, D, and F.&nbsp;

A clients, for example, are people who’ve done multiple transactions with you or have given you multiple referrals. B clients are people you’ve done one transaction with or have given you one referral. C clients are people who could potentially use you to buy or sell a home or give you a referral if the time was right. D clients are everyone else in your database (this is the biggest portion, typically). Finally, your F clients are the people you don’t want to work with or have already worked with and don’t want to again.&nbsp;

Once you have everyone categorized, you can do different things with different types of clients. It makes the most sense to invest the most amount of time and resources into your A clients, so for them, for example, you can do monthly drop-bys. You shouldn’t forget about your B clients, either, so you should drop them a line once a quarter and invite them, along with your A clients, to your quarterly events. Your C clients are people who know you, so you can influence them positively somehow. You can include your D clients, then, in your mass mailings.&nbsp;

**No matter what category they fall in, you want to take care of everyone in your database.** The only difference is the frequency in which you make contact with them.&nbsp;

If you’re not tagging your database, I recommend you start, because it’s a great way to grow your business.&nbsp;

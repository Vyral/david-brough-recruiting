If you run out of lead generation activities for the day but still feel productive, here are three things you can do to stay productive and keep building your business:

**1\. Send a CMA to people you know who aren’t selling their homes.** This will provide people in your CMA with valuable information and confirm you as a trusted resource.

**2\. Reach out to a buyer client from last year.** See how they’re doing\! If they’ve had issues with their home recently, see if you can connect them with a good service provider.&nbsp;

**3\. Send a conciliatory text to an agent you had a difficult transaction with.** Tell them that, despite having a difficult time in your transaction, you’re glad their business is doing well and you hope they have a prosperous 2021.&nbsp;

Although you may not see results from these tips right away, they’ll create goodwill and cement your status as a trusted professional with your sphere, past clients, and other real estate agents.
